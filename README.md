## **Project Overview**

Medusa Guard is an advanced automated vulnerability detection and exploitation system, designed to safeguard enterprise environments by identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities. By leveraging automation, Medusa Guard continuously monitors your system, detecting and mitigating potential weaknesses **before** malicious actors can exploit them.

**The system integrates well-established open-source tools**‚Äî**Nikto**, **Greenbone OpenVAS**, **Nuclei**, and **Metasploit**‚Äîto perform comprehensive vulnerability scanning and controlled exploitation. It prioritises security while maintaining system availability and integrity, ensuring no harmful payloads are delivered during scans.

## **Technologies Used**

#### Nikto 
A web server vulnerability scanner that quickly identifies common issues such as outdated software, misconfigurations, and dangerous files. Nikto allows for swift resolution of these issues.

#### Greenbone OpenVAS 
Offers in-depth network infrastructure vulnerability scanning. Its vast vulnerability database ensures comprehensive coverage of potential weaknesses.

#### Nuclei
Provides fast, flexible template-based scanning. Nuclei efficiently detects security flaws across applications and infrastructure.

#### Metasploit Framework
Verifies exploitability by safely testing identified vulnerabilities through real-time controlled exploitation.

---

## **Key Features**

#### Periodic Automated Testing
Supports automated scheduling of vulnerability scans and exploitation tests at regular intervals, ensuring **continuous network monitoring** for new vulnerabilities.

#### Advanced Exploitation Automation
Automatically links identified vulnerabilities to known exploits across various tools, reducing manual effort and enhancing accuracy in exploit validation.

#### Interactive Dashboard for Reports
A **GUI-based dashboard** offers real-time insights into identified vulnerabilities, trends, and remediation steps. Reports are accessible in both technical and non-technical formats, making them useful for both security teams and executive stakeholders.
