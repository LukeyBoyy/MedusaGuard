****Setup a Periodical Pentest Program****

**Project Overview**

This project aims to enhance the early detection capabilities of our organisation by establishing an automated penetration testing program. The program will regularly scan our environment for vulnerabilities and attempt to exploit them to ensure system security and data protection are maintained at the highest levels.

**Project Objectives**

Deploy a Penetration Testing Program: Implement a system that performs regular, automated penetration testing.
Improve System Security: Identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors.
Data Protection: Ensure robust protection of sensitive data within the organisation.
Training & Support: Provide comprehensive training and ongoing support for the SecOps team on the new system.

**Key Features**

Open-Source Scanning Tool: The program will deploy an open-source scanning tool to identify potential vulnerabilities.
Open-Source Exploitation Tool: An exploitation tool will be used to test the vulnerabilities identified.
Vulnerability Register Integration: Identified issues will be recorded in a register for tracking and remediation purposes.
Reporting Procedures: Detailed reports will be generated for each scan, including issue summaries, descriptions, impacts, likelihoods, and remediation recommendations.
Stakeholder Communication: Develop procedures to effectively communicate findings with management and resolver groups.

**Scope of Work**

Deployment: Set up and configure the necessary tools for automated penetration testing.
Integration: Ensure the tools integrate seamlessly with the organisationâ€™s systems without disrupting daily operations.
Reporting: Create templates and guidelines for consistent and comprehensive reporting.
Training: Optionally provide training sessions for staff to ensure proficient use of the new system.
Support: Optionally offer post-migration support and troubleshooting.

**Constraints and Limitations**

The penetration testing program must not disrupt everyday operations.
Integration with a future vulnerability register must be planned and executed without affecting system performance.
