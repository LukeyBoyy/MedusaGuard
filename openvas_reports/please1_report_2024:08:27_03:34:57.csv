  - RC4 is considered to be weak (CVE-2013-2566, CVE-2015-2808)

  - Ciphers using 64 bit or less are considered to be vulnerable to brute force methods

Generic web application scanning is disabled for this host via the ""Enable generic web application scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

Requests to this service are done via HTTP/1.1.

This service seems to be able to host PHP scripts.

This service seems to be able to host ASP scripts.

The User-Agent ""Mozilla/5.0 [en] (X11, U; OpenVAS-VT 23.4.1)"" was used to access the remote host.

Historic /scripts and /cgi-bin are not added to the directories used for web application scanning. You can enable this again with the ""Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin to directories for CGI scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

A possible recursion was detected during web application scanning:

The service is using a relative URL in one or more HTML references where e.g. /file1.html contains <a href=""subdir/file2.html""> and a subsequent request for subdir/file2.html is linking to subdir/file2.html. This would resolves to subdir/subdir/file2.html causing a recursion. To work around this counter-measures have been enabled but the service should be fixed as well to not use such problematic links.

192.168.100.28,,80,tcp,0.0,Log,80,"","Web Application Scanning Consolidation / Info Reporting","The script consolidates and reports various information for web
  application (formerly called 'CGI') scanning.

  This information is based on the following scripts / settings:

  - HTTP-Version Detection (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.100034)

  - No 404 check (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.10386)

  - Web mirroring / webmirror.nasl (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.10662)

  - Directory Scanner / DDI_Directory_Scanner.nasl (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.11032)

  - The configured 'cgi_path' within the 'Scanner Preferences' of the scan config in use

  - The configured 'Enable CGI scanning', 'Enable generic web application scanning' and
  'Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin to directories for CGI scanning' within the
  'Global variable settings' of the scan config in use

  If you think any of this information is wrong please report it to the referenced community
  forum.","The Hostname/IP ""192.168.100.28"" was used to access the remote host.

Generic web application scanning is disabled for this host via the ""Enable generic web application scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

Requests to this service are done via HTTP/1.1.

This service seems to be able to host PHP scripts.

This service seems to be able to host ASP scripts.

The User-Agent ""Mozilla/5.0 [en] (X11, U; OpenVAS-VT 23.4.1)"" was used to access the remote host.

Historic /scripts and /cgi-bin are not added to the directories used for web application scanning. You can enable this again with the ""Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin to directories for CGI scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

A possible recursion was detected during web application scanning:

The service is using a relative URL in one or more HTML references where e.g. /file1.html contains <a href=""subdir/file2.html""> and a subsequent request for subdir/file2.html is linking to subdir/file2.html. This would resolves to subdir/subdir/file2.html causing a recursion. To work around this counter-measures have been enabled but the service should be fixed as well to not use such problematic links. Below an excerpt of URLs is shown to help identify those issues.
